# OnlineKmeans
An online kmeans clustering algorithm implementation to use with Apache Spark.

This implementation is compatible with the dataframe API of Apache Spark v3.2.1

Based on the fully online algorithm described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.5721.pdf).
Authors' implementation in python can be found [here](https://github.com/sviri/kmeans/tree/main/onlineKmeans/src)

Includes an example run in the main class.

This repository is part of my thesis project for my BSc degree at Hellenic Mediterranean University.
